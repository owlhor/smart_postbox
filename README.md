# smart_postbox
Arduino C++ code for Smart postbox. This postbox has shown in Science week fair 2562  at the department of computer science, Chiangmai University

The postbox is made from plaswood. It has ESP8266 for controller. The controller will count the letters with reed switch and magnet at the box and sent notification to LINE when there're letters in. There is SH1106 that can display the amount of the letters too. 

The smart postbox can tell us if there're letters in a box via LINE application and it can also tell the amount of the letters in the postbox.
